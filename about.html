<h2>About this Blog</h2>

<p class="mb-1">This blog strives to</p>
<ul class="mt-0">
    <li>cover interesting things in Python and other programming languages</li>
    <li>introduce readers to tools that are super useful to know exist</li>
    <li>strike the same balance between opinion and fact that can be found in
        <a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python</a>. Opinionated content
        makes it quicker to skip to the meat of programming when you start out as a developer
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I'm Rachel Sharp, a London-based Software Engineer. Fond of Python, boardgames, my beaten-up T420 and
    my lil' <a href="https://galliumos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallium OS</a>-infused Lenovo N22. Hope that one day
    I'll finish all those side projects I started and abandoned.
