It’s been two years since my Raspberry Pi brutally and without warning corrupted the
data in my production database and left me high and dry with a two week old backup.
It taught me a valuable life lesson:

> Don’t run your production database on a 16GB SD Card #programmingpearls #codecompletemoron

So I totally deserved it. I had been programming for a good few years at this point,
but I was pretty inept with infrastructure. I’d dual booted my laptop and knew how to
SSH into things but that was about it. I took this as an opportunity to beef up my
hardware - the 1GB on the Raspberry Pi was starting to get a bit crippling too.

If this was a serious project it would be time to set up on AWS or Google Cloud but
realistically for a hobby project, you will end up paying a premium for the kind of
reliability and availability that business users are on these platforms to achieve.
I don't think homelab resources directly compare to AWS compute credits / bursting,
but it would have been around £800 at least, over 3 years with a reserved instance.

I shopped around for a little bit and I ended up with a [Lenovo TS150](https://lenovopress.com/lp0071-ts150-intel-xeon-e3-1200-v5-core-i3-pentium-celeron-g-series). I don’t think it’s the best out there but it was basically prefab and it was only about £120. i5 dual core, 8GB RAM and some average hard drive which I swapped out for an SSD. And it’s really quiet which is a blessing when you have a pet server living in your house.

I had a vague idea that I would want to set it up to run some VMs. I went with ESXi
for the OS since it was free and there seemed to be some degree of safety in numbers
for when I need to rely on Stack Overflow answers for everything. In hindsight I
would have looked into XenServer more or maybe ProxMox - there’s some missing
features in free ESXi that you end up needing workarounds for (like backups!)

I set up some VMs - a Docker host (virtualception!), a fileshare, a Windows VM and
a few others. I feel like with this at first, as well as the Raspberry Pi, I had a
solution looking for a problem, which was finding something to do. You can see my
current selection of Virtual Machines in the figure below, all with fairly
pretentious mostly Greek names.

￼￼
- Ouranos - the fileshare used by other services
- Styx - PfSense, Network Firewall
- Ananke - reverse proxy server frontend
- Hermes - teleport proxy
- Portunus - teleport auth
- Kubernetes - kubernetes master
- Poseidon - docker node
- Hephaestus - database server

After a point it became clear that while VMs are useful for some parts, Docker
is really where it’s at. You need a good reason why you are running something in a
VM and not a Docker container. All the VMs from the above figure are there as I didn’t
think it reasonable to dockerize them.

I was using Photon OS for a while but it’s just so vastly different from the other
OSes that it’s a real pain to maintain through batch configuration.

The next faff I encountered is that setting firewall rules on each machine slowly
withers your soul until you are left as a husk. Using PfSense I set up some Virtual
LANs which are networks connected to the same gateway, but it treats the computers
as if they were on different networks. So then you set security policies for networks
rather than individual VMs.

DMZ - internet can access, can’t access anything
Internal - has access to lock
LOCK - has access to nothing and everything internal can access
ADMIN - has access to everything and nothing can access

You don’t encounter the final faffage until you start needing to keep all these VMs
up to date, and again start doing the same things over and over on separate machines.
I’m now using Salt to remotely configure all the VMs.

- Keep to the story:
   * r pi into a bigger server
   * hardware
   * os on the big server
   * VMs on the big server
   * Docker containers on the main VM
- Final quality assurance pass
- Cool network diagrams
