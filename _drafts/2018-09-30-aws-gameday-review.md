Welcome to Unicorn Rentals! [AWS GameDay](https://aws.amazon.com/gameday/){:target="_blank"} 
invites you to try your hand at managing
the infrastructure of the biggest player in the Legendary Animal Rental Market (LARM).
An excellent parody of all the worst practices you've learned, believing in security
through obscurity and firing their engineering team every few weeks, Unicorn Rentals needs
YOUR HELP to deal with a swathe of mission-critical issues throughout the day.

Last month I attended an AWS GameDay ran for my company and had a fantastic time.
I had a smattering of AWS knowledge around buckets and EC2, and learned some more about a dozen
other AWS services. This is an overview of how the day worked and the different tasks we had to
complete, and the touches that made the event so satisfying.
