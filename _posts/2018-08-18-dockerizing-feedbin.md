# Dockerizing Feedbin

Feedbin is the best open source RSS Reader out there, but the installation and configuration process is fiendish. There are a handful of docker images that I tried, but none were at all easy to set up, so that was a loose end. I initially built the Docker image for my own infrastructure but I’m hoping what I have now is something generally applicable to other people that are looking to self-host, which I’m calling Freedbin. Hopefully easier installation and developers being able to host their own instances will help get more people involved with the Feedbin project.

You can get it from [the project page](https://github.com/rachel-sharp/freedbin), to run it using Docker. I’ve aimed to keep it easy to set up, so all you have to set is two config parameters.
