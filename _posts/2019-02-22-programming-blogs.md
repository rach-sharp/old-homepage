title: Lesser Known Programming Blogs

These are programming blogs I think are great! I've chosen some to avoid overlap with other similar compilations<sup>[1-4]</sup>
so hopefully there'll be something new for everyone. There's a few non-programming blogs at the bottom that might tangentially interest programmers too.

### Ben Cox (benjojo)  <a href="https://benjojo.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopen" class="fa fa-link ml-2"></a> <a href="https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/rss.xml" class="fa fa-rss ml-2" target="_blank" rel="noopen"></a>
Ben has the coolest homepage ever no contest. As the background, it loads an old operating system at random that you can interact with! His posts are often very hands-on with a focus on networking. Check out [his post about "Tealemetry"](https://blog.benjojo.co.uk/post/tealemetry-IOT-tea-coaster){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"}. 

### ACM Queue (Association for Computing Machinery)  <a href="https://queue.acm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopen" class="fa fa-link ml-2"></a> <a href="https://queue.acm.org/rss/feeds/queuecontent.xml" class="fa fa-rss ml-2" target="_blank" rel="noopen"></a>

ACM is a huge society divided up into many SIGs (Special Interest Groups) and Queue is a publication they release online regularly. It looks like a journal but it reads closer to a blog. Most topics in Software Engineering are covered, by a range of authors.
- [Operational Excellence in April Fools Pranks](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3171529){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"}
- [Manual Work is a Bug](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3197520){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"}

### Trivium <a href="http://chneukirchen.org/trivium/" target="_blank" rel="noopen" class="fa fa-link ml-2"></a> <a href="http://chneukirchen.org/trivium/index.atom" class="fa fa-rss ml-2" href="" target="_blank" rel="noopen"></a>
A monthly compilation of links posted with comments, mostly related to programming and maths. Some recent links from Trivium posts:
 - [CSS flexbox Tower Defense!](http://www.flexboxdefense.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"}
 - [This beautifully monstrous Regex!](http://www.drregex.com/2018/09/a-regex-i-submitted-to-reddit-climbed.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"}
 - [Gamified Propositional Logic!](https://teorth.github.io/QED/){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"}

### Muffin's Lab <a href="https://blog.monstermuffin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopen" class="fa fa-link ml-2"></a> <a href="https://blog.monstermuffin.org/feed/" class="fa fa-rss ml-2" target="_blank" rel="noopen"></a>
Muffin has a really beefy homelab ("production" environment you set up at home to play around with). Seeing
the [network diagram for his setup](https://blog.monstermuffin.org/homelab-update-august-2016/){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"} inspired me to get a
server as a Raspberry Pi replacement and tinker around with virtualization and networking.

### Zach Holman <a href="https://zachholman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopen" class="fa fa-link ml-2"></a> <a href="https://zachholman.com/atom.xml" class="fa fa-rss ml-2" target="_blank" rel="noopen"></a>
A super opinionated blog about startups and companies and working. It's like Joel on Software but feels more off the cuff. [His latest post](https://zachholman.com/posts/double-shipping){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"}
is pretty motivational about how much time you have to build things in the long run.

### Riot Games Tech Blog <a href="https://engineering.riotgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopen" class="fa fa-link ml-2"></a> <a href="https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/feed" class="fa fa-rss ml-2" target="_blank" rel="noopen"></a>
It seems like the games industry has a lot of peculiar technical challenges and this blog often goes through case
studies from Riot in a good amount of detail. You can read about:
- [their version control system I'd never heard of](https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/using-perforce-complex-jenkins-pipeline){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"}
- [some funky tech debt issues they have](https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/taxonomy-tech-debt){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"}

### The Daily WTF <a href="https://thedailywtf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopen" class="fa fa-link ml-2"></a> <a href="http://syndication.thedailywtf.com/TheDailyWtf" class="fa fa-rss ml-2" target="_blank" rel="noopen"></a>
This one is well known and also not _really_ a blog so it doesn't really get mentioned much in round-ups.
Anonymous Software Developers submit their war-stories of the crazy
things they've seen happen at work. The feature articles are the best but there's a post every weekday.
The tale of [ITAPPMONROBOT](http://thedailywtf.com/articles/ITAPPMONROBOT){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"} is a classic.

### Jeff Knupp <a href="https://jeffknupp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopen" class="fa fa-link ml-2"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/hackersgonnahack" class="fa fa-rss ml-2" target="_blank" rel="noopen"></a>
Jeff is also pretty big already, but I haven't found a better Python blog yet so it sneaks into this lesser known list. He has written some
really instructive posts on how some of the mid-level features of python work, like 
[context managers](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/03/07/improve-your-python-the-with-statement-and-context-managers/){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"}, 
[generators](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/04/07/improve-your-python-yield-and-generators-explained/){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"} and 
[decorators](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/11/29/improve-your-python-decorators-explained/){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"}.

## My Favourite Non-Programming Blogs

### Priceless Play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/priceless-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopen" class="fa fa-link ml-2"></a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/priceless-play/feed/" class="fa fa-rss ml-2" target="_blank" rel="noopen"></a>
A weekly round-up of free/pay-what-you-want games, curated by [Kat Brewster](http://www.kathrynbrewster.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"} on Rock Paper Shotgun. 
It features a lot of story-focused games from game jams and indie developers. Including games like a [pug dating sim!](https://georgebatch.itch.io/hot-date){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"}.

### The Riddler <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/" target="_blank" rel="noopen" class="fa fa-link ml-2"></a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/feed/" class="fa fa-rss ml-2" target="_blank" rel="noopen"></a>
[5:38](https://fivethirtyeight.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopen"}'s weekly logic puzzle segment. You can get on board the Riddler Express quick puzzle, 
or the longer form Riddler Classic. Although it's about maths, stats and probabilities most of 
the time, coding often helps with finding a solution for the riddles.
